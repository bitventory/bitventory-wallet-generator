Bitventory.com Offline Wallet Generator
=======================================

Description
-----------

The Bitventory Wallet Generator is a tool for generating a wallet.dat file
containing the private keys used by the Bitventory.com wallet service. These
keys can be absolutely derived using the account email address, the user's
secret passphrase, and the shared secret established on account creation.

NOTE: If you lost your shared secret or never wrote it down, the only
way to obtain it is to send an email to:

   secrets@bitventory.com

We will verify your identity and then provide the secret over a secure
channel. Apologies for the hassle, but we prefer to be paranoid. :)


Requirements
------------

This README assumes you're using a POSIX-compliant system such as a
GNU/Linux distribution of some sort (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, etc). If
you're using Windows, you'll need to obtain a package called Cygwin
and figure this out yourself.

If you'd like to contribute information on how to use this tool
with Cygwin on Windows systems, please send me a pull request.

You'll need the Java 6 JDK.

PACKAGES: pywallet (https://github.com/jackjack-jj/pywallet)
