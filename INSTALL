Bitventory.com Offline Wallet Generator
=======================================

Installation
------------

To compile the Wallet Generator from source and build a jar for
running it, simply ensure that JDK6 is installed and
run:

    ./buildGen.sh

This will produce a file called WalletGenerator.jar
which you can use.

Next, to actually import the private keys into Bitcoin,
you will need to obtain and install the pywallet utility.

Start by pulling the source:

    git clone https://github.com/jackjack-jj/pywallet

Then, copy pywallet into the Wallet Generator directory:

	cp pywallet/pywallet.py .

For more information on how to
use the package, consult the README.
